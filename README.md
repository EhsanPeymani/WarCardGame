# War Card Game

This solution is to create a card game called "war". 
This tried to follow: https://youtu.be/G4DhzhDlXFM

The CardGame project should be good for any other card games, at least with minimal changes.

I have made 2 types for stopping the game. 
One way is that one of the players has no more card. The other is when that one player has won at least 5 wars. 

A sample result is placed at https://github.com/EhsanPeymani/WarCardGame/wiki

The following screen shots are the begining and the end of the page.
